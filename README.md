### Introduction
This website was built using React and TailwindCSS for a small maggi business owner in my college. It has a simple, fast, and clean UI that takes orders and redirects to the payment gateway as the customer chooses. 

### Features
+ Tech stack: ReactJS and TailwindCSS.
+ **Responsive**: Crafted specifically for smartphones as most payments occur through that. It works perfectly on every size using tailwindCSS's utility first classes.
+ **UPI payment system**: In-built UPI payment system that automatically opens the UPI app on the user's phone with the merchants' QR and total amount fed in.
+ **UPI amount updation**: A new UPI link is generated each time the user orders, ensuring that the amount is entered automatically.
+ **Production build**: This website is currently in use by the business and works bug-free.
